#' @description This function calculates 5 centrality metrics, and also integrates the five centrality metrics of the nodes for each GRN
#'              degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvalue, and PageRank :
#'              node centrality metrics which are employed to measure the importance of nodes in the constructed networks.
#' @param network_edge_list network in the form of "edge list"
#' @param edge_prediction directed: TRUE or FALSE
#'  
#' @output The function returns a data.frame object with integrated centrality metric with corresponding p-values for each node

  # Degree centrality (number of ties)
  #Degree is the number of adjacent nodes of the corresponding node. Node with high degree is usually considered a hub with essential functions.

  #Closeness measures the average distance to all nodes for the corresponding node. Node with high closeness denotes that the node is located in the central location of network. 
  closeness <- closeness(net, mode="all", weights=NA)

  #Betweenness is calculated based on the number of shortest paths passed through the corresponding node. Node with high betweenness could be the bottleneck of the GRN.

  ###!!!
  #Note: I may need to exclude eigenvalue, because for GENIE_wRcis_centralityMetrics calculation I may encounter the following problem:
  #ERROR message was: At core/centrality/centrality_other.c:328 : graph is directed and acyclic; eigenvector centralities will be zeros.
  #PROBLEM explained here: http://users.dimi.uniud.it/~massimo.franceschet/teaching/datascience/network/katz.html

  ### Integrate the five centrality metrics of the nodes for each GRN
  
  #Apply a rank aggregation method "RRA" to integrate all centrality metrics. 
  #Finally, the rank integration score for each TF is calculated as â€“log10(p value) to indicate the final centrality measure.
